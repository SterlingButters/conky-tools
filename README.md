# conky-tools
 Collection of conky python utilities

```
sudo apt install conky-all

conky -c <path/to/conkyrc> 

```

There are a number of python utilities not linked to the conky config. This is because I'm just playing around with what I can do.
See the conkyrc for which python scripts are linked.

Notes (until I can push the changes):
1) You'll need to adjust paths in conkyrc
2) I used odrive to sync my drive locations. Odds are you don't need the odrive command in the Lectures section.
